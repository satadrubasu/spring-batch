For Batch processing consider the following options depending on the use case.

1. Single Process
    a) Multi Threaded Steps
    b) Parallel Steps  ( where each step processing doesnt impact the other step )
    c) Local Partitioning
2. Multi Process
    a) Remote Chunking - a little complex to setup
    b) Remote Partitioning 
3. Asynchronus Item processing support
   a) AsyncItemProcessor  ( wraps the ItemProcessor like a Future task etc)
   b) AsyncItemWriter
   
 In my use case lets work on a Single Process ( personal development )
